# Library-management-system
A Library Management System (LMS) is software designed to manage the day-to-day operations of a library. It streamlines library processes such as cataloging, inventory management, member registration, and book borrowing or returning. By digitizing and automating these processes, LMS improves efficiency, reduces manual effort, and enhances the user experience for both librarians and patrons.
